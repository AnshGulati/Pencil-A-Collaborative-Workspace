# Pencil A Collaborative Workspace

## Overview
The Collaborative Whiteboard Application is a real-time, web-based platform that allows multiple users to draw, interact, and collaborate on a shared canvas. It features essential drawing tools, session management, and real-time updates, making it ideal for group brainstorming and creative collaboration. The application provides a seamless experience for users to work together, regardless of location.

## Problem Statement 
Despite the advanced features offered by existing collaborative whiteboard tools, several issues persist. These include
constrained customization options, and a lack of integration with advanced functionalities such as custom real-time room
creation. Additionally, performance can be inconsistent with complex boards or high user counts, and session management
and access control features may not always meet diverse needs effectively. To address these shortcomings, our goal is to
develop a real-time collaborative whiteboard platform that enhances compatibility, customization, and performance, while
incorporating robust features for a more dynamic and versatile user experience.

## Objectives
- Develop a real-time collaborative whiteboard platform for multiple users.
- Enable different drawing pens and shape creation.
- Include real-time drawing with custom color and stroke adjustments.
- Support action history, version control, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Provide session and state management with export options for saving whiteboard content.

## Technologies Used
- **WebGL**: for Real-Time Rendering
- **WebSocket**: for Real-Time Collaboration
- **HTML5 and CSS3**: for User Interface
- **Node.js and Express**: for Backend

# Scope of the project
The scope of the project is to create a platform featuring freehand drawing, shape creation, and integrated voice
communication, all rendered with high performance using WebGL. The platform will utilize a client-server architecture
with WebSocket for real-time updates and synchronization, and WebRTC for voice chat. It will include secure user
authentication and role-based access control. Further enhancements will also explore advanced collaboration tools and a
sophisticated 3D model viewer with interactive functionalities in real-time rendering.

# Future Work
- Advanced Drawing Tools: Introduction of more sophisticated tools such as layers, vector graphics, and shape 
recognition to enhance the drawing experience.
- Dedicated Diagram Tools: Tools for creating flowcharts, mind maps, and organizational charts using customizable 
pre-defined shapes like rectangles, circles, arrows, and connectors.
- Integration with Other Platforms: Expanding the application to integrate with popular productivity tools like Google 
Drive, Microsoft Teams, and Slack for a more seamless workflow.
- Customization Options: Allowing users to personalize their workspace with themes, custom tools, and other 
preferences to cater to individual or team needs
